# 890. Find and Replace Pattern
'''
You have a list of words and a pattern, and you want to know which words in words matches the pattern.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.

(Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.)

Return a list of the words in words that match the given pattern. 

You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
Output: ["mee","aqq"]
Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation,
since a and b map to the same letter.
 

Note:

1 <= words.length <= 50
1 <= pattern.length = words[i].length <= 20
